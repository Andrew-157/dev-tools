## Dev-Tools

This repository contains my custom tools for making life easier during development. For example, a tool for searching files in a repo, or a pattern in code, etc. I know every IDE has this stuff, but first of all, developing it yourself gives you infinite possibilities for tailoring tools for yourself, giving you-specific options, that wouldn't be present in tools shipped for everyone, and secondly, it is a great way to learn something by rebuilding from scratch some utilities like `find` or `grep` commands.
